  "q":"What’s changing with Tessel 2?",
  "a":"New features on Tessel 2 include extremely reliable WiFi, an ethernet jack, two USB ports, and a system that runs real Node.js/io.js.<p>We’ve also added support for scaling up: board customization options, and services for embedding Tessel in a product.</p>"
  },{
  "q":"When will my Tessel 2 ship?",
  "a":"Tessel 2 is estimated to start shipping in January of 2016."
  },{
  "q":"What modules are available/compatible?",
  "a":"Check out our <a href='/modules'>modules page!</a>"
}, {
  "q": "How is Tessel 2 different from other development boards?",
  "a": "Tessel 2 is designed for the fastest possible path to production. Plug and play modules and high-level APIs set it apart from most other development boards. Tessel doesn't expect you to set up and maintain a Linux system or track down pinout diagrams to wire up sensors (though the root shell and GPIO access are available should you desire them)."
}, {
  "q": "Can I try out the Tessel platform?",
  "a": "Absolutely! You can find in-person communities hacking on Tessels on our <a href='/community'>Community</a> page.<p>Those communities will have original Tessels, not Tessel 2's yet, but the developer experience is very similar.</p>"
}, {
  "q": "Can I use my own USB devices?",
  "a": "Yes. First-party modules will have high-level APIs and be tested to ensure driver support, but you can also add your own USB devices if the drivers are compatible and/or you dive a little deeper into the OpenWrt ecosystem."
}, {
  "q": "How can I modify my Tessel 2 order?",
  "a": "You can access your order <a href='https://legacy.trycelery.com/myorders' target='_blank'>here</a>. You will need your order number and email address to log in. If you signed up to pay with Stripe, you should be able to add or remove modules (and Tessels) from your order. If you used Paypal, unfortunately this is not an option, but you are welcome to cancel your original order and place a new one."
},{
  "q": "I have more questions! How can I contact you?",
  "a": "For quick questions, we're <a href='//twitter.com/tesselproject'>@tesselproject</a> on Twitter. Longer questions are welcome on our <a href='//tessel.io/forums'>forums</a>, and questions about orders can be sent to <a href='mailto:support@tessel.io'>support at tessel.io</a>.</p>"
