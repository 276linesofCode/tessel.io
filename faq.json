  "q":"What’s changing with Tessel 2?",
  "a":"New features on Tessel 2 include extremely reliable WiFi, an ethernet jack, two USB ports, and a system that runs real Node.js/io.js.<p>We’ve also added support for scaling up: board customization options, and services for embedding Tessel in a product.</p>"
  },{
  "q":"When will my Tessel 2 ship?",
  "a":"Tessel 2 is estimated to start shipping in January of 2016."
  },{
  "q":"What modules are available/compatible?",
  "a":"Check out our <a href='/modules'>modules page!</a>"
}, {
  "q": "How is Tessel 2 different from other development boards?",
  "a": "Tessel 2 is designed for the fastest possible path to production. Plug and play modules and high-level APIs set it apart from most other development boards. Tessel doesn't expect you to set up and maintain a Linux system or track down pinout diagrams to wire up sensors (though the root shell and GPIO access are available should you desire them)."
}, {
  "q": "Can I try out the Tessel platform?",
  "a": "Absolutely! You can find in-person communities hacking on Tessels on our <a href='/community'>Community</a> page.<p>Those communities will have original Tessels, not Tessel 2's yet, but the developer experience is very similar.</p>"
}, {
  "q": "Can I use my own USB devices?",
  "a": "Yes. First-party modules will have high-level APIs and be tested to ensure driver support, but you can also add your own USB devices if the drivers are compatible and/or you dive a little deeper into the OpenWrt ecosystem."
